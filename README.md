# Zhong_Aixin_FINAL_INTEGRATED_ASSIGNMENT

## Portfolio Requirement: 


The portfolio site you develop this term is ultimately what you will use to present your work
and your skillset (as designers and/or developers) to potential clients and employers. As such,
the design and presentation of that design is up to you entirely, within the technical parameters
listed below. Your final portfolio site will incorporate your logo and build upon the interface/
branding designs you develop in Electronic Image and Production.
Even though the design and technical aspects of the site may develop and change over your
last term, this site should represent the basis of the site that you will have as your final
portfolio. You are required to buy/register a domain name and arrange web hosting for your
FIP. Research web hosting options and choose one that fits your requirements.
